# This program tells us how powerful an Earthquake is in relation to joules and tnt

# rscale asks for user input
measurement = (input("Please enter a Richter Scale Measurement: "))
print("You've entered in: " + measurement)

# converts measurement into joules
energy = 10**(1.5*(float(measurement))+4.8)
print("Which is:",energy,"joules")

# converts joules to tnt 
tnt = (energy * (2.390057361377) * 10-7) / 1000
print("And is also:",tnt,"tons of TNT")
