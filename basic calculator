if operator == "+":
  value = number1 + number2
elif operator == "-":
  value = number1 - number2
elif operator == "*":
  value = number1 * number2
elif operator == "/":
  value = number1 / number2
elif operator == "%":
  value = number1 % number2

# gives you the results of the math equation
print("Here is your answer: ",number1, operator , number2, "=", value)
